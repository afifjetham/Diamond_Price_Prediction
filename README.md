# Diamond_Price_Prediction
This project is built to Predict the price of the Diamond. We have used different Machine Learning algorithms like Linear Regression, KNN Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression. And later evaluated this models using R2, RMSE, etc. We concluded with the best model for our data set with highest accuracy score. Also, We did experiment tracking and model management with the help of MLFlow. We did Automation using Workflow Orchestration in Prefect. And lastly we created a Streamlit Application for our project and deployed it on Heroku cloud application platform.
